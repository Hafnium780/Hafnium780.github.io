  Various discrete simulations of 2D waves. Most break down after a long time
  because boundary conditions don't work that well.
  <br />
  If they run slowly, try shrinking the window to reduce the effort needed to
  simulate.
  <br />
  <br />
  <a href="mouse/">mouse</a> - perturb background with the movement of the
  cursor
  <br />
  <a href="square/">square</a> - propogation of an initially square displacement
  becomes circular
  <br />
  <a href="doubleslit/">double slit</a> - interference between two sources
  <br />
  <a href="lens/">lens</a> - converging lens focuses light
  <br />
  <a href="line/">line</a> - two oscillating source lines creates a stronger
  signal in the direction perpendicular to the lines
  <br />
  <a href="shadow/">shadow</a> - diffraction around an object creates a bright
  spot at the center of its shadow
  <br />
  <a href="dipole/">dipole</a> - oscillating dipole field
  <br />
  <a href="doppler/">doppler</a> - doppler effect of a moving source
  <br />
  <a href="shock/">shock</a> - shock wave of object moving at constant velocity
  <br />
  <a href="laser/">laser</a> - each cell is influenced by the cells around it
  and actively amplified, eventually reaching a resonance which forms a
  strengthened output (definitely doesn't work as intended rn)
  <br />
  <a href="gradient/">gradient index</a> - quadratic variation of index of
  refraction results in convergence of wavefronts to a common focal point (see
  EuPhO 2023/T1)
  <br />
  <a href="mirage/">mirage</a> - highway mirage effect mimics the reflection of
  light water
  <br />
  <a href="boom/">boom</a> - supersonic plane flies in variable index of
  refraction atmosphere
